# Notecarrier-Pi

This folder contains the design files for the Blues Wireless Notcarrier-Pi, in KiCad 7 format. They were generated by porting the original OrCad design files. For a detailed description of the porting process, see [PortingNotes](documentation/PortingNotes.md).

Components in this design are sourced from the [blues-kicad-lib](https://github.com/blues/blues-kicad-lib) library. However, with the exception of 3D models, KiCad produces self-contained project files. Thus this project can still be used without access to the library.
